    "# Reflection:\n",
    "# Working with CSV files and Pandas DataFrames on this ACC basketball statistics assignment taught me valuable data manipulation abilities. I learnt how to read sports performance data files, convert statistical columns to appropriate numerical types, and do basic analysis such as grouping players by school and sorting by performance measures like points and assists. These approaches are critical for sports data analysis and will be valuable in future projects across other industries. For example, I could use these skills to analyze financial data in CSV format for a commercial project, evaluate environmental sensor readings for a climate study, or review patient records for a healthcare research venture.\n",
    "# The most challenging part was getting started, especially converting columns to numeric types. I encountered errors initially, which highlighted the importance of proper data type handling. Overcoming this involved carefully examining the data and understanding pandas functions like pd.to_numeric(). This experience show me how crucial data cleaning is in the analysis process.\n",
    "# The skills gained from analyzing basketball statistics can be applied to other datasets. Similar techniques could be used in business to analyze sales data or in healthcare to study patient outcomes. The assignment has prepared me for future data challenges by emphasizing both technical skills and problem-solving abilities. It's given me a solid foundation for handling real-world data, which is often messy and unpredictable."
